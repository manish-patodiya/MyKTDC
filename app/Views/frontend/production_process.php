                        First the cloth according to the design. Since Bandhani is a textile pattern one can make
                        Panjabi Dress as well as Saree from bandhani. So the cloth is cut according to the kind of
                        the
                        dress it will be. The person who cuts the cloth is the one who transfers design on the
                        cloth.
                        Hence after cutting he sits to transfer the design through Farma.

                    <p class="p-10 ta-justify">
                        Farma is a transparent plastic sheet, on which the design is created first. This design is
                        created either by Professional Designer or by Wholesaler or sometimes by the craft people
                        themselves. In this case, the craft person is the designer and he sells his design to the
                        wholesaler. Once the design is approved they create small pin holes in the plastic sheet.
                        With
                        the help of these pin holes Design is transferred on the cloth.</p>

                        Once the Farma is ready , thebundle of the cut cloth is laid on the ground. Then the Farma
                        is
                        put on top of it. Then with the help of the colour water and Squeeze the design is
                        transferred
                        on cloth. Since the size of the cloth is big, for good transfer, this process requires two
                        people to do it. Once the Design transfer is done this person sends this transferred cloth
                        to
                        the wholesaler who, later Distributes to the ladies who during their free time do the

                        these clothes to
                        the Ladies. Bandhejis mostly done by women. These women come to the wholesaler everyday to
                        collect the new design for Bandhej and to return the ready Bandhej which then goes for
                        colouring. When these ladies come to collect the cloth for Bandhej, along with the cloth,
                        they
                        are provided with thread rolls. Tie & Dye Cluster, Kolsiya IICD Jaipur Revised DPR Page 15

                    <p class="p-10 ta-justify">
                        Bandhej means tieing knots in the specific pattern. This knot is tied because when this tied
                        cloth goes to colour this knot doesn’t let that part catch colour so it stays white or
                        whatever
                        colour of cloth has. Bandhej is the main part of the bandhani making. Bandhej is the process
                        which is repeated many times in the making of one Bandhani. Every bandani mostly has bandhej
                        two
                        times. First time when it’s distributed to Ladies for bandej and then when it goes colour.
                        If
                        the bandhani has two colours as base colour then the people who colour the cloth, also tie a
                        big
                        bandhej which is different than the small bandhej done by ladies based on design. Basically
                        there are two types of Bandhej:

                        <p class="p-10 ta-justify">
                            This Process is mostly done by women at home. So once the distribution of design
                            cloths is
                            done
                            to these women, they do the bandhej at home. Bandhej for design is a very fine small
                            bandhej
                            which needs time and accuracy. Once this bandhej is done it goes back to wholesaler
                            and they
                            send this cloth for colouring. Once the colour is done if design needs more bandhej,
                            then it
                            again goes to the ladies for one more bandhej and then again for colouring.
                            Bandhej for Basic colour
                            This Bandhej is done when the cloth is sent for the colour and it is done by the
                            person who
                            is
                            colouring the cloth. This bandhej is done using polythene and plastic thread . After
                            this
                            bandhej it goes for the colour. After colour this polythene are used again for the
                            bandhej
                            for
                            other similar bandhej. If the design demands more small and different bandhej it
                            again goes
                            for
                            design bandhej. If not then after colour they left it open to sky to dry. In summer
                            it takes
                            around 4-5 hours to dry, in monsoon sometime it takes 2 days to dry in and in winter
                            it
                            takes

                        After Bandhej for Colour is done it goes for colour. It is not necessary that every piece of
                        design have Bandhej for Colour. Some might have only design Bandhej. This kind of cloth
                        directly
                        goes for colour. Again the person who has designed it decides colours. Once the colour is
                        made
                        then they dip cloths into it for around 1 -1.5 minutes per cloth. Then it goes for drying.
                        This
                        process is used when base colour is light and the colour, which will now be added, is dark.
                        If
                        it is other way round they have to do another process, which is called ‘wet colouring’. In
                        that
                        materials are same but it is done on the stove. After colour it goes for Drying or for
